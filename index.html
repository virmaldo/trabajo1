            <h1>Thailand desperate for tourists following COVID slump</h1>
            <h2>Thailand's tourism industry is reeling from the pandemic 
                    and officials want to open more destinations to tourists, 
                    despite rising COVID cases. 
            </h2>

            <br><small style="color:grey;">Phuket: waiting for visitors</small>
            <p>
                When Sunisa (name changed) learned that the Thai government had greenlit plans 
                to reopen Phuket, the country's most popular resort island, under the pilot scheme 
                to revive tourism, she was overjoyed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like many, the pandemic has derailed her ability to earn a living. Before coronavirus, 
                she was usually busy running a private tour operator for families and small groups, 
                offering a one-stop service from accommodation to transportation and excursions.
            </p>
            <br> <img src="images/59176204_401.jpg" alt="Patong Beach, Phuket, Thailand">
            <br><small style="color:grey;">A small number of tourists have returned to Thailand as 
                part of a pilot scheme, but will it be enough to rescue the industry?</small>
            <p>
                "I thought the 'Phuket Sandbox' program would help bring back visitors and it was 
                as I had expected," the 50-year-old told DW. "Some clients have returned and my income 
                has begun to improve."
            </p>
            <p>
                While the number is nothing compared to what she used to make, Sunisa is hopeful about 
                the upcoming peak season from December to March as new bookings started to come in.
            </p>
            <h3>'Unpredictable and complicated'</h3>
            <p>
                Since July 1, overseas tourists have been able to visit the resort island without 
                <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/quarantine-in-thailand-the-good-the-bad-and-the-boring/a-55738863">having 
                    to quarantine,</a> 
                provided that they are fully vaccinated and are willing to obey an extensive list of regulations in 
                place to safely revive an industry that is in desperate need of rescuing.
            </p>
            <p>
                After staying in the area for 14 days, they are allowed to travel on to other parts of Thailand. 
                But visitors have been put off by the Thai government's unpredictable COVID regulations and 
                complicated paperwork.
            </p>

            <br><small style="color: grey;">In 2019, over 14 million travelers, including 10 million foreign 
                tourists, visited Phuket</small>
            <p>
                Just over 26,000 travelers have visited Phuket through the Sandbox program in the first two months, 
                well short of the 100,000 it was hoped would have visited by the end of September.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the numbers have fallen short of forecasts, officials are still hopeful the trickle of visitors 
                can become a stream.
            </p>
            <h3>Salvaging tourism industry</h3>
            <p>
                Like other tourism-dependent nations, Thailand's tourism sector, which made up 20 percent of national 
                income, has been hammered by the coronavirus.
            </p>
            <p>
                As much of the world struggled to contain the first waves of the pandemic, Thailand escaped last year 
                relatively unharmed, although only by shutting its borders and in turn, its tourism industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the Delta variant has seen infections, hospitalizations and deaths skyrocket since April, p
                ostponing any plans to reopen fully.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the start of September, officials eased local lockdowns, including in the capital Bangkok in order 
                to boost business, despite infection rates remaining high.
            </p>
            <p>
                The move signals a tactical shift from authorities who are now hoping to keep the contagion at 
                manageable levels and return to normalcy.
            </p>
            <p>
                So despite the alarming coronavirus caseload, Thailand is pressing ahead with plans to extend 
                its 'Sandbox' initiative to more provinces, which include the capital Bangkok, the northern city of 
                Chiang Mai, and beach resorts like Pattaya, Cha-An and Hua Hin.
            </p>
            <h3>Struggling to stay afloat</h3>
            <p>
                Hotels, small and large across the nation, are one of the hardest-hit industries by COVID-19 
                and have seen business evaporate due to the lack of visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                A recent survey by the Bank of Thailand and the Thai Hotels Association (THA) found that 52% of hotel 
                operators were considering closing their doors temporarily while 9% wanted to shut down permanently.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Small players in particular are feeling the strain. Normally, Sawita Vibhatasilpin and her business 
                partner would see 20-30 backpackers coming in and out of their small yet lively hostel in downtown 
                Bangkok everyday.
            </p>
            <p>
                But since authorities shut borders last year to contain the coronavirus, there is now plenty of space in 
                the hostel as the number has significantly dropped to 1-2 travelers per month.
            </p>
            <p>
                Small, independent budget backpacker hostels like hers are hard-pressed to survive the COVID-19 outbreak. 
                Two other hostels in the same neighborhood have already gone out of business and Sawita worries that 
                a similar fate might befall them. 
            </p>               
            <p>
                "I'm afraid that we will eventually be forced to close down. While the landlord has been understanding, 
                we have barely made any money and haven't paid any rent for the past six months," the 30-year-old said.
            </p>
